# AI-Powered Conversational Data Science Tutor ðŸŽ“ðŸš€

## Project Overview

This project is an AI Conversational Data Science Tutor designed to resolve user queries on Data Science with contextual awareness. It was developed during the Data Science With GenAI Internship at Innomatics Research Labs.

This AI-powered tutor leverages Gemini 1.5 Pro, LangChain, and Streamlit to provide an interactive learning experience for data science enthusiasts.

**Key Features:**

* **Conversational AI:** Provides accurate and context-aware responses.
* **Memory Integration:** Understands the conversation flow and maintains context.
* **Streamlit UI:** Clean, simple, and easy-to-use interface.
* **Focused Learning:** Strictly answers Data Science-related queries.
* **Real-Time Assistance:** Instant responses to user doubts.

## Tech Stack

* **Gemini 1.5 Pro:** Advanced LLM for accurate insights.
* **LangChain:** Enhancing conversation memory & context handling.
* **Streamlit:** Intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.

## Live Demo

## Key Takeaways

* Gained hands-on experience in LLM-powered AI chatbots.
* Implemented context-aware memory for improved conversations.
* Enhanced Streamlit UI/UX for a seamless user experience.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/prasadmjadhav6959/AI_Data_Science_Tutor>
    ```

2.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    (Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary packages like `streamlit`, `langchain`, `google-generativeai`, etc.)

3.  **Set up your Gemini API key:**

    * Obtain an API key from Google AI Studio.
    * Set the API key as an environment variable (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

    (Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual API key)

4.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    (Assuming your Streamlit app file is named `app.py`)

5.  **Open your browser and navigate to the displayed URL.**

## Future Enhancements

* Integration with a knowledge base for more in-depth answers.
* Adding more interactive elements to the UI.
* Expanding the scope of topics covered.
* Implement user authentication.
* Adding code execution capabilities.
